# Processing Projects

Part of a collection of projects made through Processing in Java!

## Asteroids Game

A project on a take of another arcade classic, [Atari Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game))! Here is the [main program](/breakout_/breakout_.pde), which acts as the skeleton of whole game. 

### About the Code
The code is largely spread out by the mode of the game, including:

|                 Modes                  |  
|             -------------              |  
| [Intro to Game](/breakout_/intro.pde)  |
| [Game Play](/breakout_/game.pde)       | 
| [Game Pause](/breakout_/pause.pde)     | 
| [End of Game](/breakout_/gameover.pde) | 
| and [more](/breakout_)!                |
